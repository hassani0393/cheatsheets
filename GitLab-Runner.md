# GitLab-Runner

## Installation
<p> GitLab Runner can be installed and used on GNU/Linux, macOS, FreeBSD, and Windows. You can install it: </p>

1. In a container.
2. By downloading a binary manually.
3. By using a repository for rpm/deb packages.

* You can view installation instructions in GitLab by going to your project’s Settings > CI / CD, expanding the Runners section, and clicking Show runner installation instructions.
* You should install GitLab Runner on a machine that’s separate from the one that hosts the GitLab instance for security and performance reasons.
* GitLab Runner should be the same version as GitLab. Older runners may still work with newer GitLab versions, and vice versa. However, features may be not available or work properly if a version difference exists.
* Backward compatibility is guaranteed between minor version updates. However, sometimes minor version updates of GitLab can introduce new features that require GitLab Runner to be on the same minor version.
