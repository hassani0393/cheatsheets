# Bash Scripting

## File Globbing

To represent one character:
  
    ls -l my_scr?pt

To represent any number of characters:

    ls -l my_s*t // Returns myscript.

To 'or' in a search:

    ls -l my_sr[ai]pt

To specify a range such as alphabetic:

    ls -l f[a-i]ll 

To 'not' in a search:

    ls -l f[!a]ll // won't return fall.
___

## Linking Files

### Symbolic Link

To create a symbolic link to a file:

    ln -s data_file s1_data_file // Created the symbolic link s1_data_file

<p>
The two above file's inode numbers are different to. The Inode number of a file or directory is a unique identification number that the kernel assigns to each object in the filesystem.
</p>

To view a file or directory's inode:

    ls -i data_file

### Hard Link

To create a hard link to a file:

    ln data_file h1_data_file

To check to which file a link is linked to:

    file s1_data_file

<p>
A hard link creates a separate virtual file that contains information about the original file and where to locate it, However, unlike the soft link, they are physically the same file and have the same inode number and file size. By referencing the hard link file, it's just like referencing the original file. 
</p>

<p>
The hard link can only be created between files on the same physical medium. To create a link between files under separate physical mediums, symbolic link must be used.
</p>

<p>
Try to create multiple soft links to the original file instead of creating a chain of softlinks that point to eachother and can be broken and cause problems.

<p>
Processes communicate with eachother using <strong>signals</strong>. It's a predefined message that processes recognize and choose to act on or ignore.

| 2 | INT | Interrupts |
| 3 | QUIT | Stops running |
| 9 | KILL | Unconditionally terminates |
| 11 | SEGV | Produces segment violation |
| 15 | TERM | Terminates if possible |
| 17 | STOP | Stops unconditionally, but doesn't terminate|
| 18 | TSTP | Stops or pauses, but continues to run in background |
